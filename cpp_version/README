This software is the C++ version to generate audio signals using some primitives.

It is designed to:

* be able to add more primitives in the future
* have as many as needed (output) signal channels
* change on the fly the parameters without resetting the output
* be controlled by one or more input parameters modules
* run one or more export parameters module
* output raw files or audio devices
* be cross-plateform
* be compiled on older machines with C++98
* run on older machines
* output at 48, 96 or 192KHz sample rate
* be able to add more audio interfaces in the future
* produce raw data sound files as inferce to jack_audio audio output (not yet)


The parameters are entered using two modes:

* with differential time-stamp:
  the system waits the requested amount of time for the next event. This mode is mostly intended to be used with an input parameters file. The output signal is, in general, an audio device or a raw file. 
* without differential time-stamp:
  the system execute immediately the next event.
  This mode is intended to be used with manual or remote (later) control. The output signal is an audio device, a raw file or nothing (channel number = 0). The last option is intended to debug the software or the scenario while declaring an export parameters channel.
  In such case, the software is used to convert a format into another one

If a raw data file only is defined, the software generates the data as fast as possible or while folowing the timestamps (-d option) (not yet). The first case is intended to create files used later.
